## Introduction
In the realm of product marketing, **packaging** and **labeling** play crucial roles in shaping consumer perceptions and driving sales. Packaging refers to the process of designing and producing the container or wrapper that encases a product, while labeling involves creating and attaching informative tags to these products. These two components not only protect and preserve items but also serve as powerful marketing tools that enhance visibility and consumer engagement.
