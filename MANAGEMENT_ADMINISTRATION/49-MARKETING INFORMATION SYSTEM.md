## Main Components of MIS

### Internal Data
The first component of MIS is **internal data**, which is derived from within the organization. This includes:

- **Sales Records**: Historical sales data that helps identify trends and patterns.
- **Customer Databases**: Information about customer demographics, preferences, and purchasing behaviors.

By utilizing internal data, businesses can gain insights into their operations and customer interactions.

### Marketing Research Data
