President Murumu states that the culture of adjournments should go .

#### Reasons for the lag

 reduce the burden of pendency on civil courts, the tribunal system was introduced through the 42nd Constitutional Amendment Act, 1976 to deal with specialized subjects.

But hardly any of the cases meet the time-line fixed by the statute


- As in 2024, in the Law Minister’s reply in the Lok Sabha, there are **21 judges per million** population against the recommendations of the **120th report of the Law Commission of India** of having **50 judges per million** population.
- not filling vacant posts of judges in a time-bound manner
- Giving one judge the additional charge of two or more courts, even in the so-called specialized courts that are created in haste in order to control public outcry.
- enacting pieces of legislation without prior judicial-impact assessment
-  inordinate delay in bringing witnesses to courts.
#### Judge numbers
- sanctioned strength of 1,114 judges (as on December 31, 2023), which itself is much less when compared to the population and number of cases being filed, the present strength of judges is 770 ie 30% vacancies
- In 2021, six specialised tribunals were abolished and their functions conferred on High Courts.
- there are nearly two dozen statutes which provide for direct appeal to the Supreme Court,
- dealing with so much varied work and with almost 100 cases in a day may cause great mental stress to the judge
- **Justice M. Jagannadha Rao Committee**, which proposed “judicial impact assessment” of every legislation should be implemented
