Conflict with GO 55 and GO 29
GO 55 had provision to select candidates from each reserved actegory 1:50

But in GO 29 which is amended version of GO 29 aligns with supreme court order takes whole aspirants in 1:50 ratio
>Â candidates for the notified posts would be picked from the merit list irrespective of their reserved category in the ratio of 1:50.

GO 55 ensures that candidates can compete both in the open category and reserved category, the Commission disputes this. It argues that those gaining eligibility in the reserved category would have to be confined to the same category. GO 29, on the other hand, ensures they get the opportunity to compete in both categories.
