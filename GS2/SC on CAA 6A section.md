## Origin of 6A
Section 6A originates from the `Assam Accord`, a political settlement signed on August 15, 1985, between the Rajiv Gandhi-led Congress government and Assam’s student groups, following a six-year-long agitation against the influx of undocumented migrants from Bangladesh into Assam.

## What does it do
It established a framework for granting or denying Indian citizenship to migrants in Assam based on a cut-off date — March 25, 1971. The date marked the onset of the genocide in East Pakistan, leading to the Bangladesh Liberation War and the eventual creation of Bangladesh.

>All those who entered the State **after March 25, 1971**, would be treated as foreigners and deported in accordance with law.

### Why contented
The petitioners, including the NGO Assam Public Works and the Assam Sanmilita Mahasangha, contended that setting a different cut-off date for citizenship in Assam is discriminatory and violates the right to equality enshrined in Article 14 of the Constitution.

Concerns were also raised about the provision’s inconsistency with [[# Article 6]] and [[# Article 7]], which regulate citizenship pertaining to Partition-era migration for the rest of the country.

#### Article 6
Grants citizenship to individuals who migrated to India from Pakistan before July 19, 1948, provided they have resided in the country since then.

#### Article 7
Denies citizenship to those who moved to Pakistan after March 1, 1947, while allowing it for those who returned to India under a permit for resettlement or permanent return.

## Majority Rule by SC
- SC upheld the differentiated treatment of Assam under Section 6A, citing the region’s unique historical and political considerations.
- They reasoned that the provision does not violate the equality clause under Article 14
- Represents Parliament’s careful balancing act between its humanitarian approach toward Bangladeshi immigrants and the significant strain their mass exodus has imposed on Assam’s economic and cultural resources.
- Section 6A is not inconsistent with the citizenship provisions in Articles 6 and 7 of the Constitution
- Article 11 of the Constitution grants Parliament substantial flexibility in formulating laws related to citizenship, including the authority to establish conditions for granting citizenship that may differ from those outlined in Articles 6 and 7.
- the judges further observed that Section 6A does not violate the cultural rights of the “indigenous” Assamese people. Under article 29
- While the Article 29 aims to “conserve” the culture of a specific group, it does not preclude the coexistence of other cultures.
#### Why did Justice Pardiwala dissent?
He reasoned that while the provision may have been justifiable at the time of its enactment, its failure to curb illegal migration in Assam had rendered it inconsistent with constitutional principles over time. He also noted that the lack of a sunset clause on the application of Section 6A incentivises illegal immigration and exacerbates demographic imbalances in the region.

## Misc

**4:1 decision**
- [Section 6A](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/political-parties-students-body-hail-sc-verdict-on-section-6a-of-citizenship-act/article68765402.ece) conferred deemed citizenship on all those who entered Assam from areas in erstwhile East Pakistan before January 1, 1966
 - on the other, a system of registration for those who immigrated from that day to March 25, 1971, the day Pakistan began Operation Searchlight
- The latter category of people had to be ordinarily residing in Assam and declared to be a foreigner by a tribunal before they could apply for registration as citizens.
- However, they would be ineligible to be on the electoral rolls for 10 years from the date of detection

`The majority has rejected the notion that the provision is unconstitutional on the ground that it treats Assam differentially from the rest of the country`

>It has noted that the citizenship provisions in the Constitution referred to ‘citizenship at the commencement of the Constitution’ and Parliament was not deprived of the power to introduce provisions on citizenship for a different category of people from a different date
