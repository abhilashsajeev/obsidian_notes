>In 2018, nearly 90% of rural households had simple mobile phones and 36% had smartphones. In 2022, the proportion of households with smartphones had risen to over 74% and, according to ASER 2024, it has grown further to 84% this year

Â `proportion of children aged between 14 and 16 years who own a smartphone has risen from 19% to about 31% within a year.`

>at this time, over 40% mothers of schoolchildren are not schooled or have completed school less than class five. Nearly another 40% are schooled between class six and class 10, and the remaining have completed class 10

Educating mothers so that they can help children is an investment India should make to accelerate and strengthen the education of children.
