# Chapter Summary: The Appointment of the Chief Justice of India

## Introduction
The appointment of the **Chief Justice of India (CGI)** is a crucial aspect of the Indian judiciary, directly influencing the functioning of the **Supreme Court**. While the **Constitution of India** provides a framework, it lacks explicit procedures for the CGI's appointment. This chapter explores the intricacies of this process, highlighting its significance in maintaining the sanctity and independence of the judiciary. Key terms such as **seniority**, **Memorandum of Procedure (MoP)**, and **judicial appointments** are essential for understanding this topic.

## The Constitutional Framework
- Article **124(1)** states there shall be a Supreme Court of India with a CGI, but it lacks specific procedures for appointment.
- Article **124(2)** indicates that every judge of the Supreme Court is appointed by the **President** of India.
- The absence of a clear constitutional provision leads to reliance on **convention** for appointing the CGI.

## The Role of Seniority
- The outgoing CGI recommends a successor based on **seniority**, which is determined not by age but by the number of years served in the Supreme Court.
- In cases of equal seniority, additional factors are considered:
  - Experience in the **High Court**.
  - Direct nomination from the **bar**.
  - The order of oath-taking.
- Notable exceptions exist where seniority was bypassed, such as:
  - Justice **A.N. Ray** was appointed on April 25, 1973, superseding three senior judges.
  - Justice **H.R. Khanna** was superseded in 1977.

## The Memorandum of Procedure (MoP)
- The MoP outlines the actual procedure for appointing the CGI, establishing that the appointment should be of the senior-most judge deemed fit.
- The **Union Law Minister** initiates the process by seeking recommendations from the outgoing CGI.
- The recommendation is then forwarded to the **Prime Minister**, who advises the **President**.

## Government's Role in Appointment
- The central government plays a minimal role, primarily limited to the Law Minister seeking recommendations.
- The government cannot request a review of the CGI's or the **collegium's** recommendations, differentiating the CGI's appointment from other judges.

## Powers and Functions of the Chief Justice of India
- The CGI is responsible for:
  - Allocating cases and designating constitutional benches, hence often referred to as the **master of the roster**.
  - Administering the oath to the President of India.
  - Appointing judges to the Supreme Court and High Courts.
  - Advising the government on various issues.
- In emergencies, the CGI can assume the role of acting President if both the President and Vice President positions become vacant.

## Removal of the Chief Justice of India
- The CGI can only be removed through a parliamentary motion based on proven **misbehavior** or **incapacity**.
- While the Constitution does not explicitly use the term **impeachment**, it is colloquially associated with the removal process.
- The procedure for removal is defined under the **Judges Inquiry Act of 1968**:
  - Requires signatures from at least 100 Lok Sabha members or 50 Rajya Sabha members.
  - The motion must be investigated by a three-member committee.
  - Adoption of the motion requires a majority in both houses of Parliament.

## Conclusion
The appointment of the Chief Justice of India is a pivotal process influenced by seniority, conventions, and the Memorandum of Procedure. Understanding this procedure is vital as it affects the independence and integrity of the judiciary. The CGI's powers extend beyond mere case allocation, impacting governance and constitutional interpretation. The removal process underscores the importance of accountability within the judiciary, ensuring that the CGI remains a respected figure in the legal landscape of India. The implications of this appointment process are profound, shaping the future of judicial oversight and the rule of law in the country. 

In summary, the CGI's appointment and removal reflect the delicate balance between judicial independence and governmental oversight, reinforcing the judiciary's role as a cornerstone of democracy in India.
