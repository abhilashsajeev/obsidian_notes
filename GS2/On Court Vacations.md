India has the most overburdened judiciary
The Supreme Court has a minimum of 50-75 matters every day
Judges cannot discharge justice without having read the papers to pass appropriate orders. There are almost 25,000 matters which are filed each year.

Australia’s Supreme Court, for instance, has only 97 working days when oral arguments are adduced.

If you compare holidays, Singapore’s Supreme Court has 145 holidays, the U.K.’s Supreme Court has about 180 holidays, and Canada’s has about 120

India has around 190-195 working days

`The Supreme Court website shows that the court gives a minimum of 10-15 judgments per day. On the other hand, the U.S. Supreme Court gives a maximum of 10-15 judgments a year.`


### What judge do in vacations
There are conflicts of judgments between two High Courts or more — these require a lot of deliberation. We also draw upon jurisprudence from other countries, which entails a lot of research. Apart from that, each judge is given a chance to participate in national and international seminars and conferences.

We need that amount of rest, as it is cerebral work. We also need time to spend with our judicial law clerks and instruct them to get material which enriches the judgments.

### What happens in vacations
Urgent matters are taken up during vacations. Vacation Benches are assigned, and we take turns. The National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) matter was heard for several weeks during the summer vacation.


In 1987, the Law Commission had suggested that there should be 50 judges for 10 lakh citizens instead of the 10 judges available then.
