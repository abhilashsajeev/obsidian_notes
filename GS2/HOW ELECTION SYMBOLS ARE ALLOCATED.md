As per the Symbols Order, in case of split in a recognised political party, the ECI decides as to which faction or group is the recognised political party. It allots the reserved symbol to such faction.
- However, the ECI has also frozen symbols in the past before determining the dispute.
	- The ‘two leaves’ symbol of the AIADMK party in Tamil Nadu was frozen in January 1989 and April 2017 due to competing claims
	- The ‘bow and arrow’ symbol of Shiv Sena was also frozen before a bye-election in October 2022.

## WAY FORWARD
The Supreme Court in **Sadiq Ali versus the ECI (1971)**, laid down the *3-test formula* for determining which faction is to be recognised as the original political party
1. Aims and objectives of the party
2.  Its affairs as per the party’s constitution that reflect inner party democracy.
3.   Majority in the legislative and organisation wings.

>Since the organisational election of NCP in the year 2022 was shrouded with doubt, it went on to decide the issue solely based on majority in the legislature as a majority of legislators supported the Ajit Pawar faction.

 The decision of the ECI to recognise the Ajit Pawar faction as the real NCP has also been challenged in the SC by NCP(SP) after recent win of 8 seats by NCP(SP)
