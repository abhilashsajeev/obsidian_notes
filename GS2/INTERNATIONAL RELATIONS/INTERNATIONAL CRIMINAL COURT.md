## FEATURES
- Established by Rome Statute 1998 to try individulas. It is a UN Agency
- It complements national courts and intervenes only when they are unwilling or unable to act
- A major challenge to its enforcement is the absence of its own police force. Instead, it relies entirely on member states to apprehend suspects.
- It also cannot try individuals in *absentia*, requiring member states to arrest anyone under an ICC warrant found within their jurisdiction.

## Challanges
-  Perceived inability to hold the U.S. and its allies accountable.
- As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, US can also veto any attempt to initiate a referral through the Council.
- ICC has struggled to gain the membership of major powers, including the U.S., China, and Russia.
-  Burundi left in 2017 after the court decided to investigate its crackdown on opposition protests. 
- In 2019, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte pulled out, rejecting the ICC’s inquiry into his war on drugs and insisting that domestic courts were sufficient to uphold the rule of law.
- African nations, in particular, have expressed discontent towards the court’s tendency to disproportionately target the continent.
-  The ICC has also been criticised for focusing on “low-hanging fruit” crimes — prosecuting warlords and rebel leaders while failing to hold senior political figures accountable
- This frustration was exemplified in 2018 when the court’s appeals chamber overturned the conviction of Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo, commander-in-chief of the Mouvement de Libération du Congo.
- Decline in number of trails
	- This year, apart from delivering two verdicts, the court will oversee only a single ongoing trial, with no other cases expected to reach the trial stage
- cloud of sexual harassment allegations against the ICC’s chief prosecutor.

## Conclusion
To preserve its legitimacy and public trust, the ICC must address these internal issues with unwavering transparency and accountability.
