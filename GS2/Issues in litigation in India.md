## REASONS FOR DELAY

### Judges side

- Judges Have Crucial Role yet *Systemic Pressures* Compromises their ability to do so
- District Judges have to priorities cases as targets from Higher courts regarding disposals based on case types
- Higher courts often impose deadlines without fully considering impact on overall scheduling.
- Judges not incentivized  to adhere to Statutory limit on disposal
- Judges those who enforce this deadlines may face pressure from bar affecting promotions due to constant complaints
- Unit system of judge evaluation > More **Challenges**
    - Points based on the type and number of cases they dispose
    - Tries to dispose of more number of simpler cases to gain points
    - *Contributes to delay in complex cases*

### Lawyer Side

- Handling multiple cases across different courts on same day
    - Depends on important case, chance of adjournment, mood of judge
- Lack of predictability in Hearing, Strategic behavior to delay proceedings.
- Tendency to extending stay (No incentive to speedup proceedings once stay is granted)
