The U.S. Constitution mandates that instead of securing the popular vote, the winner is the candidate who clinches the **maximum number of electoral college** votes.

#### What is the electoral college?

The electoral college is an intermediary body or process that chooses the U.S. President. In this system, voters of each State cast their ballots to choose members (or electors) of the electoral college who then vote to select the President.
The number of electors accorded to each State is in proportion to its population and mirrors its number of members in Congress — both the House of Representatives and the Senate. The system, whose origins can be traced back to the days of slavery, was put in place to ensure States got equal representation in the election process.


#### What is the process?
In the months leading up to the election, different parties nominate their slate of would-be electors in each State. The slate of the party that wins the popular vote in a State goes on to become electors from that State in the electoral college.

Conventionally, these electors meet in December and go by the will of their citizens to vote for the candidate who won the popular vote in their State.

If an elector votes against the citizens’ choice, they are called **faithless electors**, and some States have provisions to **prosecute them**.

the winner of the popular vote gets all electoral votes of that State (and the District of Columbia); in other words, “**Winner takes all**”.

There are 538 electoral votes in the college and a candidate must secure at least 270 votes to become President.


#### In case of tie
Article 2 of the U.S. Constitution and the 12th Amendment mandate that the election moves to the House of Representatives where the newly elected 435 members are sworn in and vote on who becomes President.
