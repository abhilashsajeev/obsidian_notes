# Subdivision of SC
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, the principal architect of the Indian Constitution, believed that formal legal equality (one person, one vote) would not be enough to dismantle the deeply entrenched inequalities of caste.Thus, reservations were mandated to become a mechanism to move from legal equality to **substantive equality** by creating opportunities for SCs and STs in higher education, public sector jobs, and government institutions.


>Bihar’s experiment with subdividing the SC quota into a “Mahadalit” category in 2007 is a cautionary tale. Initially designed to target the most marginalised SC groups, the policy eventually faltered as political pressure led to the inclusion of all SC groups in the Mahadalit category, effectively nullifying the purpose of the subdivision.

### Is reservations accessabile
This highlights a fundamental problem with the current system — access. Without ensuring that all eligible SCs can actually benefit from reservations, subdividing the quota becomes a secondary concern

### is quota withing quota solution
The idea of a ‘quota-within-quota’ is not without merit. In States like Punjab, where there is a clear disparity between SC subgroups, subdividing the quota has helped bring more disadvantaged groups into the fold.
