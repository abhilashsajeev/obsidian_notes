# SAMSUNG FACTORY STRIKE CHENNAI SRI PERUMBADUR

> Indias Largest electronics workers protest
>  This plant contributes *third* of 12 billion USD revenue of samsung in India

## Reasons
-   Demand of Higher wages
-   And recognition of Labour union
-   Better working conditions (Samsung India Workers Union -CITU)
-  Providing a **three-year salary** increase to Rs.36,000 (70 per cent in 2024, 15 per cent in 2025, and 15 per cent in 2026),
-    Providing **Rs.500** annual service weightage,
-    Increasing shift allowance from **Rs.150** to **Rs.250**
-    Extending paternal leave from three to seven days
-    Equalising pay for workers with the same qualifications and duties.
-    **Trade union registration has been pending**
-    Despite the Government of India’s 45-day time limit for trade union registration under the Trade Unions Act, 1926, over 90 days have passed without resolution
-    Seoul Protests also aligns with this
-    While India has laws for union formation, there’s no mandate for company recognition

## Status
- 80 percent production is down
- Suffered loss of $100 million due to workers’ strike, Samsung tells Madras High Court
- The company opposes the use of the word ‘Samsung’ in the name of the new trade union affiliated with CITU
- [[TRADE UNION ACT 1926]] does not prohibit the use of a company’s name
- Even at its headquarters, trade unions had been using the word ‘Samsung’ in their names.
