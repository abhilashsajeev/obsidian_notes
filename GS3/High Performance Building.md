>HPBs are designed to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, minimise energy and water use, and cut operational costs using climate-adaptive designs. They also improve their occupants’ well-being, making them attractive to both businesses and occupants.



The European Union’s ‘Green Deal’, which targets climate neutrality by 2050, mandates energy-efficient building designs and retrofits

>The construction industry contributes about 39% of energy-related carbon dioxide emissions worldwide


#### How is India supporting HPBs?

India has made significant progress in promoting energy-efficient buildings through initiatives under its National Action Plan on Climate Change. The Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC), developed by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE), aims to reduce buildings’ energy demands by up to 30%. The Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment (GRIHA) lists more than 3,000 registered projects focusing on sustainable practices and lowering carbon emissions. The Indian Green Building Council (IGBC) promotes energy-efficient designs, with more than 14,000 certified projects covering 12.5 billion sq. ft.
>The BEE is targeting 30% of new buildings to achieve net-zero status by 2030, in line with the national commitment.
