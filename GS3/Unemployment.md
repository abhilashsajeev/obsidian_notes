>India is not producing enough good quality jobs for its people. A good quality job provides dignity, adequate compensation, an opportunity for learning, and advancement for those who strive

The seemingly low unemployment rate masks the fact that to count as employed, a person needs to have reported **working for only one month in an entire year**.

Work has become the dominant entry point into a broader sense of community and political engagement

The disparity is likely to worsen as technological advancements and capital concentration potentially displace large numbers of workers, perhaps permanently.

## Is Universal Basic Income a Solution
- inequality and an assault on human dignity are inherent in the very concept of Universal Basic Income

- UBI implies that a significant portion of the population is no longer needed in the economy, with a smaller subset “paying” for the rest
- UBI would shift focus from structural reforms to mere economic transfers and thus entrench elite power by insulating them from pressures to address fundamental inequities in the economy and labour markets
- It risks recasting the state as a mere distributor of funds rather than the architect and arbitrator of societal processes required to create a just and participatory social and economic system
