## Why is Big Tech scouting for nuclear power
> Google announced the “first corporate agreement” to buy nuclear energy from multiple [[Small Modular Reactor]] (SMR)

### Need
- Training AI models, ensuring that they remain always online, and maintaining growing data centres are energy-hungry tasks
-  In a 2024 Environmental Report, Google admitted that its total global greenhouse gas emissions rose by 13% in 2023 year-over-year,
- decarbonize the grid in support of our commitment to become carbon negative
### Reason for Nuclear
nuclear energy was clean, available round-the-clock (unlike solar energy), and carbon-free

>Microsoft and Constellation signed a 20-year power purchase agreement intended to launch the Crane Clean Energy Center (CCEC)

>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman backed the nuclear startup Oklo

#### Is nuclear energy truly clean?
**This is still a matter of debate**
-  has a serious reputation problem, due to public memory of past accidents and crises that span generations.
- Chernobyl human error, but Fukushima demonstrates how natural disasters beyond human control - such as a tsunami - can lead to a devastating nuclear accident
-  U.S., the Three Mile Island accident of 1979 in Unit 2
- Many environmental groups are actively protesting against nuclear energy and the way it is being presented as “clean energy.”
- Nuclear reactors have a long history of accidents, leaks, extended outages and skyrocketing costs (**Friends of the Earth**)
