# Victims Register at Bastar

 The government’s declared approach to deal with left-wing extremism has been to address the challenge in a holistic manner, in the areas of security, development, ensuring the rights of local communities, and with improvements in governance and public perception management.
### Victims
- Those who suffered from maoist
- Those who suffered from state
- Salwa judum camp peoples
- Tribal communities
>55,000 tribals fled Chhattisgarh to take shelter in then unified Andhra Pradesh


### Way forward
- the exercise of identifying victims shall have to be in the spirit of truth and reconciliation and agnostic to the nature of the perpetrators who carried out victimisation.
- victims and their families need to be given a benefit of doubt when they tell their stories, as many versions cannot be cross-checked in a tangible manner.
- The ground rules of the exercise shall have to be based on trust
- The said measure shall be an impactful confidence-building measure and is bound to expand the support base of the state against the Maoists
