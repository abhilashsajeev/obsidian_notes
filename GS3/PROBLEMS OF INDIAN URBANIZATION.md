India’s urbanization is largely driven by economic distress, resulting in “poverty-driven urbanization,” with both rural-to-urban and urban-to-urban migration.

 World Bank estimates suggest around 40% of India’s population live in urban areas, in around 9,000 statutory and census towns.
Despite the 74th Constitutional Amendment, most Indian cities remain controlled by undemocratic bodies

Though cities have elected representatives, they rarely control urban planning, which is often outsourced to parastatals and private entities.

> For example, less than three of the 18 functions outlined in the 12th Schedule have been universally transferred to urban governments,

> cities receive a mere 0.5% of the GDP in intergovernmental transfers.
