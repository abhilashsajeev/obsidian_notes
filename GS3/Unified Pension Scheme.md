## Key Features and Benefits of the Unified Pension Scheme
### Government Approval and Background
- The UPS was approved by the **Union Cabinet** as a major reform in the pension system.
- **Prime Minister Narendra Modi** emphasized that the scheme ensures dignity and financial security for government employees, reflecting a commitment to their well-being.

- For employees with more than **10 years** but less than **25 years** of service, the pension will be calculated on a pro-rata basis.
- In the event of an employee's death before retirement, family pensions will provide **60%** of the last drawn pension amount to the spouse, ensuring financial security for dependents.

  4. Additional provisions for addressing inflation through **Dearness Allowance**.
  5. A commitment to adjust the scheme based on actuarial assessments.

### Minimum Pension and Inflation Adjustments
- The scheme guarantees a **minimum pension of ₹10,000 per month** for employees who have served at least **10 years**. This provision protects against inflation and ensures a safety net for retirees.
- **Inflation relief** will be calculated based on the **All-India Consumer Price Index** for industrial workers, ensuring that pensions keep pace with rising living costs.
