- increase in overall allocation in gender budget statement
- Gender Budget statement has been releasing from 2005 onwards this includes schemes across union ministries and departments with full or part allocations for women and girls.
- **MGNREGS** states that it will guarantee at least a **third** of its allocation for women. and historically around half of the workers have been women.
- From early two part GBS till FY 2024-25 now a three part 
	- **Part A** 100% allocations for women and girls.
	- **Part B** 30-99 % allocations
	- **part C** 1-29% allocation
- Total allocation of 4.49 lakh crore in Fy 2025-26 a welcome **37%** increase from previous FY
- From 5% of total expenditure of GBS in 2019-20 increased to 9% of total expenditure in Fy 2025-26
- NRLM has shifted from Part B to Part A since 2024-25 increased allocations.
- Addition of part C reflects that all Union ministries and departments must have a gender lens.

### Problems
- Part A allocations have been stagnant over time.
	- Because ministries and departments are increasingly trying to incorporate a gender lens in the scheme allocations that's why B and C are up
	- Also suggest ministries are arbitrarily allocating or misallocating schemes with components for women and girls. 
	- Example Jal Jeevan Mission features part B of GBS this year with 31% allocation earmarked for women. but previous two years it was 49% also in FY 2023-24 BE for JJM was inexplicably missing in GBS shows arbitrariness in reporting of gender focused allocations
- PMAY-G in part A of GBS means that 100% of the allocations direct towards name. But data shows only 23% of houses have been allotted to women (as on feb 1 2025)
- mission Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 features in both part a and b., the logic is questioned
- also when scheme was restructured in FY 2021-22 the name of PM Matru bandana yojana disappeared. this makes it opaque and tough to monitor

## Conclusion
Only an accounting exercise that highlights allocations for women and girls in inadequate to deliver the promise of *Nari Sakthi* It must be accompanied by measures such as gender-oriented audits conducted regularly across ministries. This will enable the govt to go beyond the low hanging fruit of reporting allocations for women and girls and truly reflect commitment towards empowering women.
