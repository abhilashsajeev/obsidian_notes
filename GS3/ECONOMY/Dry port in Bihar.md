## What is dry port
#gs3 #economy #infrastructure
A dry port, or inland container depot (ICD), provides a logistics facility away from a seaport or airport for cargo handling, storage, and transportation. It acts as a bridge between sea/air ports and inland regions, facilitating efficient movement of goods.

## Why Bihar needed it
- Bihar's export items — mainly agro-based, garments and leather products — are manufactured in diverse locations
- cargo from various shippers can be consolidated at the dry port, making it easier to transport. 
- The best part of a dry port is that it handles customs clearance procedures, reducing congestion at seaports/airports.
