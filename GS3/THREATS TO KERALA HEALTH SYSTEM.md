## Threats to kerala health system

> Recent events out outbreak of Nipah, Primary Amoebic meningoencephalitis(PAM).

*Why Nipah viruses only in kerala?*

> An ongoing nationwide survey in 14 States by NIV Pune has found Nipah virus antibodies in fruit bats (Pteropus medius) in nine States, including Kerala, and the Union Territory of Pondicherry.  
> Detection is more in kerala
> 
> ==The four outbreaks in five years may be because the virus has either become endemic in bats in Kerala or is a reflection of Keralaâ€™s superior healthcare system that thoroughly investigates undiagnosed fever cases for possible Nipah virus infection or both==

**Nipah Spread in other countries**

- Palm Date Sap - Bangladesh
- Pigs as intermediaries in Malaysia  
    List the route of virus transmission from bats to humans has not been clearly established in Kerala.

PAM was deadly for all cases between 2016 to 2020 but new cases could be prevented as government imported **Miltefosine** from Germany. Navaikulam is latest case reported is near trivandrum

- Free Living amoebas can be seen in flowing water also not only in pond
- **Global Warming** is attributed as one of reason of rise of these cases
- Children are found more susceptible as cribriform plate(seperates nasal cavity and the skull) has more porous openings compared to that of adults
- Another Possibility of **Granulomatous amoebic encephalitis(GAE) - free living amoebas CAN BE PRESENT EVEN IN AIR**

### **way forward**

- Need Genome Sequencing (Challange as the size of ameoba DNA is small)
