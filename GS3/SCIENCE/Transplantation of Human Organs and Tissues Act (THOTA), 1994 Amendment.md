## Aim
to facilitate retrieval of cornea from all Indian patients who die in hospitals, without consent from the family.

> Country able to meet only 50% of requirement

- those not willing to donate cornea should have registered their unwillingness to donate while alive
- medical officers working in eye departments â€œmust be given compulsory training in cornea/eye retrieval
