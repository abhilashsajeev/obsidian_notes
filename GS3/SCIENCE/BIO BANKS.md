# BIO BANKS

## What is a bio bank
> A biobank is a repository of biological samples, such as blood, DNA, cells, tissues, and/or organs alongside their genetic data.

The Indian precision medicine market is estimated to be growing at a CAGR of 16% and is expected to be worth more than $5 billion by 2030 [News Article](read://https_www.thehindu.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thehindu.com%2Fsci-tech%2Fscience%2Fprecision-medicine-india-barriers-biobank-diversity-data-protection%2Farticle68748285.ece)

## BENIFITS
- Recognizing genetic diseases
- There are 19 registered biobanks in India

However, biobank regulations in India are a significant hurdle to realising the full potential of precision medicine.

## Challanges

- ‘National Ethical Guidelines For Biomedical And Health Research Involving Human Participants’ and the Department of Biotechnology’s (DBT) practices for data storage and analysis have many gaps
- participants are expected to consent to providing samples without knowing how their data will be used, who will have access to it, for how long they will be stored, and when they will be used
- absence of a single authority to regulate biobanks and no penalty for misconduct
