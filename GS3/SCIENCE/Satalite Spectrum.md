International Telecommunication Union (ITU), a specialised agency of the United Nations (UN).satellite spectrum is coordinated and managed by ITU

### The Telecommunications Act, 2023
1st schedule mentions about it
 Under Section 4(4) of the Act, telecom spectrum shall be assigned through auction “except for entries listed in the First Schedule for which assignment shall be done by administrative process”

A few countries such as the United States, Brazil, and Saudi Arabia, have held auctions for frequency spectrum in the past.


In the case of satellites, the same spectrum is non-exclusive in nature — and can be used by multiple satellite operators to serve the same geographical area.Both countries have since reverted to administrative assignment after finding the auction process infeasible.
