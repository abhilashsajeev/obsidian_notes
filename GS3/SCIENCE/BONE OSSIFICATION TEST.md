## What is bone ossification
>Ossification is the natural process of bone formation that starts in infancy and continues through adolescence.

` During this time, various bones in the body undergo calcification, or hardening, as essential minerals like calcium and phosphorus deposit in the bone structure. As a person ages, this process slows, and bones eventually become more fragile.`

-  Test involves examining x-rays of certain bones, such as the clavicle, sternum, and pelvis,
	-  These bones are chosen because they tend to undergo significant structural changes as a person ages.
	-  By studying which growth plates in the clavicle have fused, forensic professionals can estimate an individualâ€™s age.
	-  The sternum, or breastbone, also ossifies in a series of segments known as sternebrae. These segments fuse over time
